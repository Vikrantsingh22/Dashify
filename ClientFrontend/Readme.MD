# Client Frontend

This project contains the frontend client component of the Dashify.

## Setup Instructions:

1. Navigate to the `ClientFrontend` directory:
   ```
   cd ClientFrontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the frontend React server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

**Note:** Ensure that the frontend React server is running at [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) on port 5173. Otherwise, the axios requests will fail to reach the backend.
